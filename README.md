# Full Page Component

This project implements a full-page component with an image background, a translucent overlay, a centered title, and a button that triggers an alert when clicked. The component is designed to be responsive and work on all screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the full-page component.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles for the component, including layout, positioning, and responsiveness.
- `script.js`: Implements functionality for the button click event to trigger an alert.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the full-page component.
3. Click on the "Click here" button to trigger the alert.

## Notes

- The component is designed to be full-page, full-width, and full-height, ensuring it works on all screen sizes.
- The image used in the background should be provided by the FE engineer and referenced in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag in the HTML file.
- The overlay's transparency can be adjusted by modifying the RGBA value in the CSS.
- The component utilizes modern CSS features and native JavaScript, assuming the usage of the latest browser features and APIs without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.
