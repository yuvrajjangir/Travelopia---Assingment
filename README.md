# Notes : 

1) The HTML structure consists of a container div with a full-page image, an overlay, and content (title and button).

2) The CSS ensures the image covers the entire viewport, adds a translucent overlay, and centers the content vertically and horizontally. It also sets overflow: hidden; on the body and HTML to prevent any potential small white space at the bottom of the page.

3) The JavaScript adds an event listener to the button to display an alert when clicked.

4) The image needs to be provided by the FE engineer and referenced in the HTML src attribute.

5) CSS properties like object-fit: cover ensure the image is optimized for different screen sizes.

6) The overlay's transparency can be adjusted by modifying the RGBA value in the CSS.

7) This solution utilizes modern CSS features and native JavaScript for simplicity and efficiency. It assumes the usage of the latest native browser features and APIs, without worrying about cross-browser compatibility.
